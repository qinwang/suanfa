00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,431
Today we're going to talk about linear
programming, including the simplex

2
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:12,055
algorithm which ranks as one of the most
important algorithms of the twentieth

3
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:17,489
century so certainly has to be included in
any course on algorithms. And so what is

4
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:23,693
linear programming? well you'll have a
fairly clear idea after the end of the

5
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:29,136
lecture. And in effect you can take an
entire course on linear probing,

6
00:00:29,136 --> 00:00:35,008
programming. or actually do graduate study
in linear programming. or get a

7
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:40,584
high-paying job in linear programming.
Programming so it's quite a bit to define.

8
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:46,021
so we talk about shortest paths and,
Maxwell's problem solving models, and

9
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:51,799
linear probing, programming is a general
problem solving model, that works in a lot

10
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:57,508
of contexts. so shortest path max flow,
that's fighting the minimum or the maximum

11
00:00:57,508 --> 00:01:03,125
of, some kind of quantity. And a good way
to think of linear probing is, programming

12
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:08,124
where it's most, not often used in
practice, is you want to allocate scarce

13
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:14,059
resources among a number of competing
activities. And you want to do it, in, in

14
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:20,527
a way that, minimizes costs or maximizes
something. That's the basic idea. And, it

15
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:27,451
encompasses, a huge number of, problems
that, we've considered, And even, plenty

16
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:34,299
of problems that we haven't considered. so
this is, an example, of a linear program

17
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:40,099
that we're going to use, throughout this
lecture. So it's got, a couple of,

18
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:46,709
components. So, So one of'em is called an
objective function. and so we say, we have

19
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:52,254
some variables. and we want to maximize
the objective function. And so our, our

20
00:01:52,254 --> 00:01:57,940
goal is to find values of the variables
that'll maximize the objective function,

21
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,982
subject to constraints in the acquaint,
constraints are linear inequalities. and

22
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:10,464
usually, including that the variables are
positive. so, there's two steps the first

23
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:18,367
is whatever problem you have you have to
formulate it like this that's reduction.

24
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:25,153
You take your problem and you convert it
into this form. And, then the second thing

25
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:31,141
is to solve it. that's what linear
program, programming is. And, it's

26
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:37,822
significant because it's widely applicable
to re al world problems. there's fast

27
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:45,640
commercial. programs out there that. will
solve huge linear programs. and it's a key

28
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,511
sub-routine for solving even more
difficult problems. But it's the idea that

29
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:56,383
it's. a widely applicable model that we
can actually do solutions for huge

30
00:02:56,383 --> 00:03:02,763
problems. For example, airlines use linear
programming to schedule the planes and

31
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:08,624
pilots and flights. And Delta recently
claimed that linear programming,

32
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:15,152
programming saves it over a $100 million
per year. so, it's general and we can

33
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:21,091
solve problems. That's what linear
programming is. And very general. Here's

34
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:28,030
just a short list of problems where you
can find papers where people used linear

35
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,889
programming to solve these problems. From
direct mail advertising to, as I

36
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:41,522
mentioned, airline crew assignment there's
problems in science Ising spin glasses in

37
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:48,846
physics, sports scheduling, baseball and
basketball in electrical engineering and

38
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:55,072
designing computers, or blending petroleum
products. All kinds of things, so a huge

39
00:03:55,072 --> 00:04:03,523
number of applications. It's a very
general model. so let's take a look at. a

40
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:09,525
little more detail of a full application.
And we're gonna do it based on a classic

41
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:15,458
paper in Scientific American in 1980. that
certainly, I don't know if it was

42
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:21,319
intended, but certainly does appeal to
college students, cuz it's all about using

43
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:27,393
linear programing to, to decide how to
best make beer and ale. That's why it's

44
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:33,711
called the brewers problem. So here's the
idea. So, for example, to try to make sure

45
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:39,919
that everybody understands what linear
program, programming really is. It was

46
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,800
developed by Bob Bland who also
contributed to, a lot to the practice of

47
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,008
linear program, programming as well. Okay.
So the small brewery is supposed to

48
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:58,380
produce both ale and beer. Now, there's
raw materials that go into both ale and

49
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:05,787
beer. There's a few other things but the
main ones are corn. hops and malt, and the

50
00:05:05,787 --> 00:05:14,012
brewery has a certain amount of each one.
say it's got 480 pounds of corn, 160

51
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:21,035
ounces of hops, and 1,190 pounds of malt.
So that's the resources that are

52
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:27,354
available. Now there's, they k now how to
make two things. They know how to make ale

53
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:33,205
and they know how to make beer. And
there's a recipe for the ale and the beer

54
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:39,360
that uses these scarce resources. So to
make a barrel of ale, you need five pounds

55
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,829
of corn, four ounces of hops and 30. Five
pounds of malt. and to make a barrel of

56
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:53,367
beer you need much more corn and less malt
and a little bit more hops. So that's the

57
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,688
recipes for those two things. And the
other thing is that there's different

58
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:06,740
profitability. So you can make $thirteen
per barrel of ale and $23 per barrel of

59
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,224
beer. So the brewer's problem is what do
we do? How much ale and how much beer

60
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:21,531
should we make? so, the pro- situation is
that depending on how much ale or how much

61
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:29,580
beer you make you have different amount of
profit. So let's say, someone says, well

62
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:36,574
let's make it all out of ale. Le, let's
make as much ale as we possibly can. so

63
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:43,207
turns out that 34 barrels of ale is the
most that you could possibly make, because

64
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:50,231
that uses up all your malt. so you need 35
pounds of malt per barrel and 34 times 35

65
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:56,943
is 1190. That's all that you have. so, if
you make 35, 34 barrels of ale, that's the

66
00:06:56,943 --> 00:07:05,530
max that you can make. and then, if you do
that 34 times thirteen is $442 of profit

67
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:13,242
that you make if you make all ale . what
if you make all beer? Well, if you make

68
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:18,792
all beer, then corn is the limiting
resource. You need a lot of corn to make

69
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:24,128
beer. you're going to need fifteen pounds
per barrel. You can only make 32 barrels.

70
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:29,678
and you have plenty of the other
resources. but if you did make all beer,

71
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:35,227
you'd make $736. So, if you're going to
make all beer or all ale, you're gonna go

72
00:07:35,227 --> 00:07:41,648
with the all beer. but you can do things
in between. The if you used up all the

73
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:48,695
hops it would be 19.5, well you can't
really make a half barrel so we're not

74
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:55,655
going to consider that case. But if you
could it still wouldn't be as good as all

75
00:07:55,655 --> 00:08:04,832
beer. but what about this mix here? If
we're making twelve barrels of ale and 28

76
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:13,042
barrels of beer. then the amount of hops
that you need. you can multiply it out.

77
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:18,512
That would use up all the hops. About 160,
o unces of hops that you've got. so

78
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:25,252
that's, restricted by the number of hops,
And also uses up all the corn, that you've

79
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:31,991
got. and if you do twelve <i>, thirteen, for
the ale. And 28 <i>23 for the beer. you make</i></i>

80
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:37,398
a profit of $800. So out of these
alternatives, that's the one you're going

81
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:42,656
to choose. Make twelve barrels of ale, and
28, barrels of beer, and you're going to

82
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:50,674
maximize your profits. that's the brewer's
problem and now the question is can we do

83
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:57,341
better? We've just been fooling around a
little bit and seeing which one uses up

84
00:08:57,582 --> 00:09:04,490
resources is there some way that we can do
better? so that's really the brewer's

85
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:10,515
problem. I got the scarce resources. I've
got the objective function. I want to

86
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:18,514
maximize my problems while sticking to the
resource constraints. So, this is a linear

87
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:25,104
programming formulation of the Brewer's
problem. It's a mathematical formulation

88
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:32,605
of the problem. And all we're doing is
expressing these various constraints with

89
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:39,846
math. so A is the number of barrels of ale
that I wanna make, and B is the number of

90
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:46,356
barrels of beer. my profit is $thirteen
for each barrel of ale, and $23 for each

91
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:53,760
barrel of beer. So I want to maximize 13A
plus B, and then I'm subject to all these

92
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:01,560
constraints that are given to me by the
recipes. the And, for the ale, it's, it's

93
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,934
the five units of corn, four units of hop,
and 35 units of malt. And for the beer,

94
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:12,511
it's fifteen, four, and twenty. so, if I
make A barrels of ale and B barrels of

95
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:17,885
beer, then I'm subject to this constraint.
And it's all, all the corn that I have.

96
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:23,666
And so forth. And of course I have to pick
a positive number of, barrels of ale and

97
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:29,945
beer. That's a mathematical formulation of
the problem. so that's linear programming.

98
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:37,925
That's reducing the Brewer's problem to a
mathematical formulation. so now, we wanna

99
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:45,695
look at, try to get a better understanding
or geometric intuition on what this thing

100
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:52,336
means, in so. Of the key ideas is the
thing called feasible region. So, we have

101
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:58,478
two variables. So, we are gonna plot all
the possible points, all the possible

102
00:10:58,478 --> 00:11:04,465
amounts of ale and beer we can make just
in the xy plane. So, it's positive xy

103
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:10,918
plane, because we are gonna make positive
amount of beer and positive amount of ale.

104
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:18,427
In the other constraints, actually defined
half plains so that is, the amount of corn

105
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:25,436
has to be, you have to have 5A plus 15B
less or equals 480. If you draw the line

106
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:32,530
out of 5A plus 15B equals 480, which is
this line here, and it intersects way out

107
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:38,545
there. Than, everything, above this line
is not feasible. We don't have that much.

108
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:44,329
And everything below that line is possibly
feasible. And, actually, all we do is just

109
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:50,786
intersect all the half blanks including
the half blank above the X axis, and to,

110
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:56,031
the right of the Y axis. And if you do
that, you'll get a complex, convex

111
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:04,950
polygon. it's and all the points inside
are things that we could possibly do. so

112
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:12,409
it's a first idea. We have inequalities
that satisfy all those inequalities

113
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:20,237
simultaneously defines a complex convex
region like this. and what about the

114
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:28,777
objective function? Well that's just
another line. And so that's a line of

115
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:40,424
slope If you take 13A23B plus 23B that's
the objective function, and any point, if

116
00:12:40,424 --> 00:12:47,300
you, look at where this line of the same
slope, intersects the, convex region, you

117
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,238
can see that what we're going to be
looking at is, we want the one that, goes

118
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:58,353
up the highest. you can't get higher
profit if you, if you have a line that is

119
00:12:58,353 --> 00:13:03,511
a bigger number then you're not going to
be in a feasible, feasible region. So that

120
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:08,001
you can see, it's a, the objective
function defines the slope of a line. And

121
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:12,794
what we found, want to find is, you think
of it the other way. The line coming in

122
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:17,891
from positive infinity. Where does it hit
the feasible region? that's where our

123
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:23,909
profit's gonna be maximized. so just the
geometry tells us that the optimal

124
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:30,475
solution is going to be at an extreme
point. in this case it's where you know,

125
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:36,466
we have two variables. It's where two
constraints intersect. so that's already a

126
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:41,931
huge improvement in terms of solving the
problem rather than having to consider

127
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:47,396
this infinite number of points that
describe the amount of ale and amount of

128
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:52,926
beer that we might make. we only have to
consider this finite set of points which

129
00:13:52,926 --> 00:13:58,523
are the extreme points in the feasible
region and one of those is going to be our

130
00:13:58,523 --> 00:14:07,135
optimal. . So, that brings us to the
standard form of a linear program in

131
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:14,890
general. In general, we have way more than
two variables. and we have lots of

132
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:22,034
different linear equations. so what we're
going to do is and actually we're going to

133
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:30,081
get rid of in, inequalities and just deal
with equalities. And we'll talk about that

134
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:35,839
in a minute. and this is just to try to
get a form that makes all the problems

135
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,702
seem the same so that we can work with
them. And this again is the power of

136
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:45,760
reduction. We're just using reduction to
get the problem in a form that we can

137
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,544
fully understand it and solve it. so the
general statement of a linear program,

138
00:14:52,544 --> 00:14:58,800
it's going to be you've got some
variables. and the, you want to and the

139
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,010
variables you are going to assist are all
positive. and the objective function is a

140
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:08,074
linear combination of those variables.
That just means we multiply by constants

141
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:12,822
and add them. All the constraints also
will be linear equations. However many

142
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:18,132
constraints there are, there can be any
number of constraints. the constraints

143
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:23,376
might be redundant, the problem might be
over constraints all of that has to be

144
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:28,355
dealt with in a linear programming
solution, and you don't have things like

145
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:33,612
multiplying together variables or any
thing like that. so your input is the

146
00:15:33,612 --> 00:15:39,185
coefficient, for the objective function.
And also the coefficients for all the

147
00:15:39,394 --> 00:15:45,317
linear equations and also the radiant
sides. in your output I use the result of

148
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:51,030
solving the linear program and problem.
It's the values of the X's that maximize

149
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:57,370
your objection function subject to all the
constraints. now people define standard

150
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,944
forms of linear programs in different
ways. And you can find all different sorts

151
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:10,163
of slightly different standard forms. this
one is really convenient to express as a

152
00:16:10,163 --> 00:16:18,754
matrix. where A and, A is a matrix and B
and C are vectors. and it's just those and

153
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:27,818
X is a vector, column vector. you're just
sat isfying maximizing The that's, that's

154
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:32,820
just saying the same thing in much more
compact notation. so as I mentioned,

155
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,991
there's no really widely agreed notion of
standard form. So you'll find different

156
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:43,669
standard forms in different context,
usually. So now our brewer's problem

157
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:50,844
didn't have equalities, it had
inequalities. So we have to convert that

158
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:58,102
to the standard form basically get rid of
the inequalities. And it's really easy to

159
00:16:58,102 --> 00:17:05,952
do, and once you get used to this idea,
then we'll use it again later on. so the

160
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:13,508
first thing is, is, so instead of Mm-hm.
maximizing a linear combination, we're

161
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:19,474
actually going to, just maximize a single
variable. And we're going to add that and,

162
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:25,861
and then make the objective function an
equation. so when I maximize Z, subject to

163
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:32,697
the constraint that 13A plus 23B minus C
equals zero. That's the same as maximizing

164
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:38,782
13A plus 23B. And then we just add slack
variables to convert each of the

165
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:44,717
inequality, it's called a variable that
takes up the slack. so if five A plus

166
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:50,727
fifteen B has got to be less than or equal
to 480, that's the same as saying that

167
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:56,615
five A plus fifteen B plus something
positive has to equal 480. so, it's just

168
00:17:56,615 --> 00:18:02,322
saying the same thing. add a slack
variable SC. And say that it's got to be

169
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:07,379
positive. So now we have a bunch of
equations. and just all positive

170
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:13,736
variables. So it's, it's more variables,
but less variability. we've kind of got a

171
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:19,949
variable for everything in the system. so
that's a conversion of the brewer's

172
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:26,013
problem to the, standard form of linear
programming. now just a little bit more

173
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:31,783
about the geometry before we get to the
solution. Again, the, inequalities to find

174
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:37,409
half spaces, so when you intersect them
you get something convex. You can't get

175
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:43,107
something like this because the half space
will just chop it off. So that's really

176
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:49,165
important and that's in two dimensions. so
convex just means that if you have two

177
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:55,080
points that are in the set everything in
the line between them is also in the set.

178
00:18:55,493 --> 00:19:02,062
an, an extreme point is something that
you, you can't write as a linear

179
00:19:02,062 --> 00:19:07,797
combination of something in the set. so
that's just the geometry of it. and that's

180
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:12,847
in two dimensions. and this is very
intuitive in two dimensions. In higher

181
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:18,561
dimensions it's hard to really trust your
intuition so that's why we have these

182
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,523
specific geometric definitions. Now the
extreme point property still holds even in

183
00:19:25,523 --> 00:19:32,058
higher dimensions. This is three
dimensions and now after three dimensions,

184
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:38,770
we really have to use our imagination. But
still the same idea of a bunch of

185
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:45,482
intersecting half spaces in higher
dimensions. And the same basic idea holds

186
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:52,194
if just you stick with the basic math
definitions. And so they all intersect.

187
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:58,049
And the good news is that still, inside is
an infinite number of all possible

188
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:03,170
solutions, but there is only a finite
number of these plains and so they

189
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:09,013
intersect, there's only a finite number of
intersections. That's a good news rather

190
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:14,927
than having to examine infinite number of
points. We just have to examine a finite

191
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:20,770
number of these external points but the
bad news is that there could be a lot of

192
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:26,540
them, it can be exponential in number of
constraints. So that's the extreme point

193
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:35,110
property. Now, it's, because of this idea
of the extrema has to be where the

194
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:41,071
solution is. if you find a, a local
optimum, place that's just, better than,

195
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:48,102
everybody connected to it, that's just
going to be actually a global option that

196
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:55,365
follows from convexity. so, if the, it's
actually a good situation that if you can

197
00:20:55,365 --> 00:21:02,289
just get to a place that, you can't
improve from, then, you're in good shape.

198
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:08,880
That's a kind of test, that's the geometry
of the, linear programming problem.
